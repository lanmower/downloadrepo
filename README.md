With apptoapp, you can streamline your development process like never before. Here's how it works:

Step 1: Make sure you have your OpenAI API key ready. You can set it as a variable (OPENAI_API_KEY) or have it available in a .env file locally.

Step 2: Open your terminal and run the following command:
```
npx apptoapp your prompt goes here
```
This command will perform magic on your code, minify it, apply special prompts to ChatGPT, and then write the modified files back to your file system. It's that simple! ✨

🚀 Ultra Fast Prototyping
🌍 Language Translation
